      	<p>Mallory Furniture is your provider of life changing and home altering furniture. 
   			We believe that furniture carries with it the emotion of joy. It can breathe life into 
      		your home and reshape the way you interact in your domestic realm. We feel that your 
      		home should reflect who you are and how you want those closest to you to feel when they 
      		enter a room. It is a long journey from manufacturing, to retail, and finally to your home.

      		Mallory Furniture is committed to our role in delivering furniture along its journey of happiness.
